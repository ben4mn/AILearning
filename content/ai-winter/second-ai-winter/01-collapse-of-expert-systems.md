# Collapse of Expert Systems

## Introduction

By 1987, the expert systems industry seemed unstoppable. Billions of dollars flowed into AI. Hundreds of companies built and deployed knowledge-based systems. Conferences overflowed with enthusiasts. The future belonged to AI.

By 1993, the industry had collapsed. Companies closed. Projects were cancelled. AI departments were eliminated. The term "artificial intelligence" became so toxic that researchers rebranded their work as "machine learning" or "data mining" to survive.

This was the second AI winter—and it hit the expert systems industry hardest.

## The Peak: 1985-1987

### Market Size and Optimism

The expert systems market peaked in the mid-1980s:

| Year | Market Size (estimated) |
|------|------------------------|
| 1985 | $250 million |
| 1986 | $500 million |
| 1987 | $1+ billion |

Some analysts projected $4 billion by 1990.

### The Players

**Hardware vendors**:
- Symbolics, LMI, TI: LISP machines
- Sun, Apollo: UNIX workstations
- Intel, Motorola: AI-capable processors

**Software vendors**:
- Teknowledge, IntelliCorp, Carnegie Group: Tools and consulting
- Inference Corporation, Neuron Data: Development environments
- Dozens of smaller players

**Corporate AI groups**:
- Nearly every Fortune 500 company had AI initiatives
- Dedicated AI labs with substantial budgets
- Thousands of expert systems under development

### The Confidence

Industry voices were triumphant:

> "Expert systems represent a new form of software that is fundamentally different from—and in important ways superior to—conventional software." — Industry report, 1986

> "We are at the beginning of a knowledge revolution." — Technology journalist, 1987

## The Cracks Appear

### Deployment Failures

Many deployed expert systems failed to deliver:

**Case: Insurance Underwriting**
- $5 million development cost
- 2 years to build
- Never achieved promised accuracy
- Abandoned after 6 months

**Case: Manufacturing Configuration**
- Worked in demos
- Failed on actual orders
- Too many edge cases
- Required constant hand-holding

**Case: Financial Trading**
- Encoded expert rules
- Markets changed faster than rules could adapt
- Losses followed

Across industries, the gap between demo and deployment proved vast.

### Maintenance Nightmares

Successfully deployed systems faced ongoing challenges:

**Rule proliferation**: XCON grew from 2,500 rules to over 10,000
**Interaction complexity**: Rules affected each other in unexpected ways
**Expert dependency**: When experts left, knowledge couldn't be updated
**Validation difficulty**: Hard to verify correct behavior across all cases

The cost of maintaining expert systems often exceeded the cost of building them.

### Technology Mismatch

Expert systems required:
- Expensive hardware (LISP machines or high-end workstations)
- Specialized skills (knowledge engineers)
- Extensive customization per deployment
- Integration with existing systems (often difficult)

Meanwhile, general-purpose computing was advancing rapidly:
- PCs became powerful enough for many tasks
- Off-the-shelf software proliferated
- Networks connected systems cheaply
- Standards enabled interoperability

Expert systems looked increasingly expensive and isolated.

## The Collapse: 1987-1993

### Timeline

**1987**: First warning signs
- Desktop Publishing, not AI, drives computer sales
- Some AI startups struggle

**1988**: Market growth stalls
- New LISP machine orders decline
- Corporate AI budgets questioned

**1989**: Decline accelerates
- Symbolics financial crisis
- Multiple AI startups fail
- "AI winter" term coined

**1990**: Collapse in progress
- Expert system projects cancelled en masse
- AI departments downsized or eliminated
- Industry publications fold

**1991-1993**: Bottom
- Symbolics declares bankruptcy
- Major vendors exit market
- Survivors rebrand away from "AI"

### Corporate Retreat

Company after company retreated from AI:

**GE**: Closed AI labs, absorbed technology into engineering
**AT&T**: Dramatically reduced AI research
**DEC**: XCON maintained but no new AI investment
**Boeing**: AI projects cancelled
**Banks and insurers**: Expert systems abandoned

CFOs demanded ROI. AI couldn't deliver.

### Startup Devastation

The startup landscape was devastated:

**Symbolics**: From peak to bankruptcy
**IntelliCorp**: Sold at fire-sale price
**Teknowledge**: Massive downsizing
**Inference Corporation**: Pivoted away from AI
**Carnegie Group**: Absorbed into larger firm

Venture capital that had flowed into AI redirected elsewhere.

## Why It Happened

### Overpromising (Again)

History repeated. The AI community had again promised more than it could deliver:

**Promised**: Systems that capture and apply human expertise
**Delivered**: Brittle systems requiring constant maintenance

**Promised**: Knowledge that transfers across domains
**Delivered**: Every system built from scratch

**Promised**: Practical deployment in 6-12 months
**Delivered**: Projects spanning years, often failing

### The Knowledge Acquisition Bottleneck

The fundamental problem was never solved. Getting knowledge into systems remained:
- Labor-intensive
- Error-prone
- Never complete
- Constantly outdated

There was no shortcut. Every domain required massive investment that rarely paid off.

### Technology Shift

The computing landscape shifted away from AI's strengths:

**From**: Specialized, expensive machines
**To**: Commodity hardware running standard software

**From**: Custom development
**To**: Off-the-shelf applications

**From**: Expert programmers
**To**: End-user computing

Expert systems didn't fit the new world.

### Recession

The early 1990s recession accelerated the collapse:
- IT budgets cut across industries
- High-risk, high-cost AI projects first to go
- ROI scrutiny intensified

Economic pressure revealed AI projects' vulnerability.

### Competition from Simpler Solutions

Many problems that had seemed to require AI proved solvable with simpler approaches:
- Better database queries
- Spreadsheet models
- Statistical analysis
- Simple rule engines

If conventional software worked, why pay for AI?

## The Human Cost

### Researchers

Academic AI researchers found:
- Funding difficult to obtain
- "AI" label a liability on grant applications
- Pressure to rebrand research
- Diminished prestige

Many shifted focus to neural networks, machine learning, or left the field entirely.

### Practitioners

Industry practitioners experienced:
- Layoffs across the sector
- Skills devalued
- Career pivots required
- Disillusionment

Knowledge engineers became database administrators. AI consultants became general IT consultants.

### Lost Knowledge

When projects cancelled and teams dissolved:
- Systems were abandoned
- Documentation was lost
- Techniques had to be rediscovered
- Institutional knowledge vanished

## What Survived

### Embedded Expert Systems

Some expert systems survived embedded in larger applications:
- Credit scoring components
- Diagnostic modules
- Configuration tools

They stopped being called "AI" but kept working.

### Business Rules Engines

Expert system technology evolved into business rules engines:
- Encoded policy and decision logic
- Integrated with enterprise applications
- Less ambitious than AI, but useful

Companies like ILOG (later IBM) and Fair Isaac continued in this space.

### The Ideas

Many expert system concepts persisted:
- Rule-based programming
- Knowledge representation
- Inference engines
- Explanation facilities

They reappeared in different contexts with different names.

## The Rebranding

### "Artificial Intelligence" Becomes Toxic

By 1993, AI was a term to avoid:
- Grant proposals avoided it
- Startups chose different names
- Research papers used alternative terminology

### The Euphemisms

What AI researchers called their work:

| Original Term | Replacement |
|--------------|-------------|
| Artificial intelligence | Knowledge-based systems |
| Expert systems | Decision support |
| Machine learning | Data mining |
| Neural networks | Connectionism |
| Natural language | Text processing |

The substance often remained; the label changed.

### Why Rebranding Worked

By avoiding the AI label, researchers could:
- Escape the hype-and-disappointment cycle
- Set more modest expectations
- Obtain funding without political baggage
- Build credibility through incremental results

It was survival strategy.
