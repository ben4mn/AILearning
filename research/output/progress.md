## Notes

Era 1 (Foundations) completed. Topics cover:
- Alan Turing and the philosophical foundations of machine intelligence
- Early neural networks from McCulloch-Pitts through the Perceptron controversy
- The Dartmouth Conference and the birth of AI as a field
- Symbolic AI and the Logic Theorist/GPS era
- Early NLP from machine translation through ELIZA and SHRDLU

Era 2 (AI Winter & Expert Systems) completed. Topics cover:
- The first AI winter: hype cycle, Lighthill Report, funding collapse
- Expert systems from DENDRAL through MYCIN to the 1980s commercial boom
- LISP and Prolog: the languages of AI, plus LISP machines
- Knowledge representation: semantic networks, frames, ontologies, Cyc
- The second AI winter: expert systems collapse, hardware failure, seeds of revival

Mind map connections established between Eras 1-2 topics and forward links to later eras (Statistical NLP, Backpropagation Revival, LLMs).
